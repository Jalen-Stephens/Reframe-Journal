# Reframe Journal

**Reframe Journal** is a private, CBT-based thought journaling app designed to guide users through structured **automatic thought records**, cognitive reframing, and reflection.

This project is primarily intended as a **personal tool** to make evidence-based therapy exercises easier to complete in real moments of distress, rather than something that feels like homework.

---

## Purpose

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) thought records are a powerful tool for identifying automatic thoughts, examining evidence, and developing more balanced perspectives — but they can be difficult to complete consistently, especially when emotions are high.

Reframe Journal aims to:

* Reduce friction when starting a thought record
* Guide users step-by-step through the CBT process
* Help users reflect on patterns over time
* Keep all data **private and local to the device**

---

## What This App Is

* A **guided thought record journal**, based on standard CBT worksheets
* A **private, offline-first tool** (no accounts, no cloud storage by default)
* A **structured alternative** to free-form journaling
* A tool focused on **reflection and cognitive reframing**, not mood tracking alone

---

## What This App Is Not

* ❌ Not a replacement for therapy
* ❌ Not a diagnostic or medical tool
* ❌ Not a social platform
* ❌ Not designed to provide clinical advice or treatment

This app is meant to **support therapeutic practices**, not replace professional care.

---

## Core Features (Planned)

* Guided thought record flow:

  * Situation
  * Automatic thoughts + belief ratings
  * Emotions + intensity ratings
  * Cognitive distortions (optional)
  * Adaptive responses
  * Outcome re-rating
* Local-only data storage
* Edit and review past entries
* Optional pattern insights over time
* Optional AI assistance for reframing (opt-in, per entry)

---

## Privacy Philosophy

Privacy is a core principle of this project.

* All entries are stored **locally on the device**
* No accounts or logins
* No data is shared by default
* Any future AI features will be:

  * Clearly labeled
  * Explicitly opt-in
  * Avoid unnecessary personal details

Users should feel safe writing honestly.

---

## Technology (Planned)

* Cross-platform mobile app (iOS + Android)
* Built with **React Native**
* Local storage only
* Minimal external dependencies

---

## Project Status

This project is currently in the **planning and design phase**.

Initial focus:

* Define therapeutic flow
* Design calm, low-friction UX
* Maintain strict scope boundaries

Implementation will follow once the core experience is clearly defined.
